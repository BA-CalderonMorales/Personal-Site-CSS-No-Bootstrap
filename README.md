# Personal-Site-CSS-No-Bootstrap

I created this website using both what I've leared from the tutorials on Udemy.com,
 as well as the applying what I've learned so far from devCodeCamp.

I've updated some of the code to coincide with devCodeCamp style. File paths were main issue. Currently attempting to populate images to the live webpage. Will be updating Projects section as I create more and more projects.
