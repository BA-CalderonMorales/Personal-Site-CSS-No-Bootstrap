# Personal-Site-CSS-No-Bootstrap

I created this website using both what I've leared from the tutorials from Udemy.com, 
as well as the devCodeCamp that I'm currently in (Summer, '21).

Updated some of the code to coincide with devCodeCamp style. File paths were main issue.
Currently attempting to populate images to the live webpage.
